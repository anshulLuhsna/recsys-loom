# Overnight results

This report is updated as the Option C research program finishes each
controlled stage. Development numbers are mean MAP@12 on the 2020-08-31 and
2020-09-07 2K folds. The reserved 8,000-customer 2020-09-16..22 holdout is not
inspected until `BEST_SYSTEM` is frozen.

## Evaluation integrity

The dataset ends on 2020-09-22. There is no unused calendar week.

Previously inspected “final” metrics used 2020-09-16 through 2020-09-22 on
overlapping 100 / 500 / 1K / 2K / 5K customer draws. Those numbers are
contaminated reference measurements, not a pristine test.

Official final evaluation: **customer holdout**. 10,610 validation-week buyers
were already seen. 58,374 were unused. 8,000 unused IDs are reserved in
`artifacts/overnight/holdout_customer_ids.txt`.

See `docs/evaluation_ledger.md`.

## Frozen prior conclusions

These stand unless a new controlled development result overturns them:

- LightGBM LambdaRank is the strongest ranker family so far.
- DCN V2 overfit and is not being blindly retried.
- Metadata two-tower is complementary and budgeted at K=50.
- Generic image-only DINOv2 retrieval is rejected.
- Text has retrieval signal but did not consistently improve final MAP.
- History-based two-tower routing is rejected.

## Baseline

`BASELINE_RANKER` is frozen under the development protocol.

| Fold | MAP@12 | Recall@12 | Hit Rate@12 | Train positives |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 2020-08-31 | 0.02638 | 0.04143 | 0.1135 | 3,675 |
| 2020-09-07 | 0.02776 | 0.04468 | 0.1170 | 5,476 |
| **Mean** | **0.02707** | | | |

Candidate-pool oracle MAP@12 is about 0.29 on these 2K development folds, so most of the remaining gap is ranking and irreducible next-week uncertainty, not missing retrieval of an already-found item. Historical 5K Sep 16–22 MAP@12 ≈ 0.028 is a contaminated reference only.
